#BACKGROUND

Here, I created scripts for setting up the multi tier Application Stack of my product, talentX locally.
This local setup will be particularly usefull for two things:
 - serves as the baseline for other projects.
 - will be used for the R&D of the talentX project

#SCENARIO

This local setup is IAAC and a completely automated process


#TOOLS

Hypervisor (Virtualbox)

Automation (Vagrant)

CLI (Git Bash)

IDE (Sublime Text, Notepad ++, etc)
