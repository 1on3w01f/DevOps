#DevOps

In this project, we have a product called TalentX. 
TalentX is a web Application where employers find and hire the best professional talents in the area of DevOps and 
Cybersecurity across the globe.

It is a website written in Java. TalentX consists of multiple services - Nginx, Apache Tomcat, RabbitMQ, MemCached, & MySQL.
These services will form the website stack. The website will be deployed and tested across the following platforms.
      
      Local setup - Using vagrant to create VMs on a local Machine & deploying these services on the VMs using automation
      Docker - the entire application set will be deployed and ran on docker containers
      AWS Cloud - the entire project will be deployed and ran on the AWS cloud platform (PaaS & SaaS)
      Kubernetes - the entire project will be deployed on Kubernetes Cluster


The goal of this project is to showcase my expertise in these areas of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
