#DevOps

In this project, we have a product called TalentX. 
TalentX is a web Application where employers find and hire the best professional talents in the area of DevOps and 
Cybersecurity across the globe.

It is a website written in Java. TalentX consists of multiple services - Nginx, Apache Tomcat, RabbitMQ, MemCached, & MySQL.
These services will form the website stack. The goal of this project is to showcase my expertise in these areas of DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). The website will be deployed and tested across the following platforms.
      
1. Local setup - Using vagrant to create VMs on a local Machine & deploying these services on the VMs using automation

2. Docker - the entire application set will be deployed and ran on docker containers

3. AWS Cloud - the entire project will be deployed and ran on the AWS cloud platform (PaaS & SaaS)

4. Kubernetes - the entire project will be deployed on Kubernetes Cluster
